"""
Host toolchain: wraps whatever cc/c++/ar/strip/make is on PATH.

Uses the host system sysroot (sysroot = None).  Binaries compiled with
this toolchain link against the host libc, not the buckos-built one.
Suitable for quick dev/testing where exact libc matching doesn't matter.

Usage:
    buck2 build //packages/linux/core:zlib --config tc.mode=host
