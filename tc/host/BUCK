"""
Host PATH toolchain: wraps whatever cc/c++/ar/strip/make is on PATH.

Used as the bootstrap fallback when the bootstrap configuration
transition is active — host tool targets build with host PATH tools
to break the circular dependency with the seed toolchain.

Also usable directly during initial bootstrap when no seed exists yet.
