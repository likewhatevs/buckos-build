# Fruit - Dependency Injection Framework for C++
# Fruit is a dependency injection framework for C++, loosely inspired by the Guice framework for Java.
# It uses C++ metaprogramming together with some C++11 features to detect most injection problems at compile-time.
# It allows to split the implementation code in "components" (aka modules) that can be assembled to form other components.
