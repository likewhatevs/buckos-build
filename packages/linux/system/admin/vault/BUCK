# vault - Secrets management tool
# NOTE: Disabled - HashiCorp Vault has complex build requirements and version-specific
# Go toolchain dependencies. The build uses vendored golang.org/x/tools which is
# incompatible with newer Go versions. Consider using prebuilt binaries or waiting
# for HashiCorp to update their build system.
