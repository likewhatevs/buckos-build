# blst - BLS12-381 signature library
#
# blst (pronounced 'blast') is a BLS12-381 signature library focused on
# performance and security. It is written in C and assembly.
#
# This library uses a custom build.sh script rather than autotools/cmake.
# The build process compiles assembly and C sources into static and shared libraries.
#
# USE flags:
#   static-libs - Build and install static libraries
#   portable    - Build portable version (no CPU-specific optimizations)
