# spawn-fcgi - Spawn FastCGI processes
#
# spawn-fcgi is a utility to spawn FastCGI processes. It's used to start
# FastCGI applications independent of the web server. This is especially
# useful with nginx and other web servers that don't have built-in FastCGI
# process management.
#
# Originally part of lighttpd, now maintained as a separate project.
